- 👋 Hi, I’m @DarrinPohlman
- 👀 I’m interested in transforming organizational performance with easy-to-use technologies, business process automation, rich data insights, and integrated enterprise systems, data, and processes.
- I am pursuing my master's degree in business analytics at the University of North Carolina at Wilmington (UNCW). Through these courses, I have gained hands-on experience in building descriptive, prescriptive, and predictive analytics using Excel, Tableau, AMPL, R, and Python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with healthcare, pharma, biotech, and clinical research companies to bring great medicines and devices to patients in need.  I am also looking to help payors ease the patient financial burdens of these innovative therapies.
